Table of Source Codes used in CRUTEM station database,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
This table corresponds to the two-digit source codes are used in version CRUTEM.5.0.0.0 and all earlier versions.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"Only an overall source code is given for each station, which indicates the dominant source.",,,,,,,,,
"For some stations, all values will have come from that single source.",,,,,,,,,
"For other stations, values will have come from multiple sources, and the overall source code just indicates the dominant source.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"(See separate table for the six-digit source codes to be used in version CRUTEMsdb.5.1.0.0 and later, and for which individual source codes are also given for each monthly value.)",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"For each source, a homogeneity indicator is given, together with approximate start and end years of the period to which homogenisation may have been applied (in some cases this may be unknown or too complex to express as a simple start and end year), and any further comments.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Homogeneity indicators:,,,,,,,,,
HOM00=homogeneity has not been assessed or is unknown,,,,,,,,,
"HOM01=homogeneity not assessed, but data comes from a reliable source (e.g. an NMS or WWR) that probably checked for obvious problems (in the sense that they wouldn't have provided series which had obviously problems).",,,,,,,,,
"HOM02=homogeneity assessed and inhomogeneities corrected at source (by NMS or a regional effort in e.g. Nordic countries, China etc.) but method details were not available to us",,,,,,,,,
HOM03=homogeneity assessed and inhomogeneities corrected at source via documented methods,,,,,,,,,
HOM04=homogeneity assessed and inhomogeneities corrected by CRU using documented methods,,,,,,,,,
